  The material has a diffuse texture which can be set to one of the textures
  created in the TextureManager. The name have to match. The material also
  has other properties like reflectance, specularity and shinyness,
  which can be set to make the appearance different when shading.
  The value of texture_diffuse_type tells whether the texture is of STANDARD=0
  type  which means it is read from an image file. Other types are
  CHECKERBOARD=1 which is a procedural texture.
